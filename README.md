# My Leetcode Progress

## Brief Description
This is the repository where I'll be recording my progress on doing as much Leetcode Problems as I can. 👨🏽‍💻
I'll be doing most of them on Python 3, unless I found it easier to solve them on another language (Swift or C++).
If you got any better solution on any of the problems, please make a Pull Request on it. 🙌🏽

## Objective
At least 1 problem per day 🏆 no matter the Topic or Difficulty. 
I'll try to get at least 100 problems done by **December 31, 2021**

## Problems Done ✅
> Current Progress: **2 out of 100** problems done.
